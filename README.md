# Witches Drop Blaze Powder

This pack tweaks what witches drop when killed in two ways:
1. It adds blaze powder as a possible drop.
2. It increases the number of glass bottles that may be dropped.

**Note:** If you are using this pack with Vanilla Tweaks' More Mob Heads, make sure Witches Drop Blaze Powder is loaded _after_ More Mob Heads. Witches Drop Blaze Powder should be at the bottom of the list if you run the `/datapack list` command.
